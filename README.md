# [Ace of Blades](https://danielilett.itch.io/ace-of-blades)
A game about throwing more swords at a totally willing sacrifice than your opponents. This civilisation takes its traditions very seriosuly, so it turned them into organised sport. Of the bloody kind.

# Overview
+ Throw more swords at the Sacrifice than your opponents, against the time limit.
+ Beware falling swords and those thrown by your opponents - if you're hit, you'll die and respawn with no swords!
+ The first development goal was to support as many players as possible. It manages to support 8 people playing locally. It could theoretically support up to 16, but from a game design perspective... ugh.
+ Gameplay is inspired in parts by other games:
  + Towerfall - sword-throwing is based on Towerfall's arrow-firing;
  + Nidhogg - fencing-style sword mechanics, while pared back, channels Nidhogg;
  + Super Smash Bros. - Many of the menus, and the easy drop-in 8 player gameplay of the game, were heavily inspired by Smash.
+ It was originally started during Ludum Dare 43 but never submitted for the jam, hence the repository name.

# Software
+ Unity (Game Engine) and Visual Studio used for most of development;
+ Affinity Designer used for most art/vector drawing;
+ Kenney's AssetForge and Blender used for Connection Screen swords.

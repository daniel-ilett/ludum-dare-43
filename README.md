# Ace of Blades
A game about throwing more swords at a (totally willing) sacrifice than your opponents. This civilisation takes its traditions very seriosuly, so it turned them into organised sport. Of the bloody kind.

The main goal of the game was to support as many players as possible, so up to 8 (eight, ocho, huit, acht) people can connect locally. It was inspired in many ways by Towerfall, Nidhogg, and Super Smash Bros. - see if you can match up which bits of the game I stole from where!

It was originally started during Ludum Dare 43 but never submitted for the jam.
